I interpreted the theme of Everything is Alive as a way to "rebirth" by having a game centered around recycling. Since recycling is very important here at CSU, I felt it was a good way to think about they life cycle of everyday items. I also made sure to include different objects that came alive that usually are not supposed to. 
To play the game, you use the arrow keys or ASDW. You are the main character who is tasked with collecting the cans around the map. Once you've hit more than five points, you can advance to the next level. There is watermelon that is supposed to represent food waste, which is not recyclable, therefore it takes away from the points. In the second level, there are recycling trucks that are driving and interfering with the collection of the cans. In the third level, there are racoons that are trying to damage the player and preventing it from getting to the recycling center. The objective of the game is to bring the cans to the recycling center. Once the player has made it, the game ends. 
I made it a 2D pixel game because I restarted playing Minecraft and I watched the movie too. 
I was proud of the racoons being able to chase the player whenever they got too close. It was a fun aspect to have instead of the racoons just being an obstacle for the player. 

I used a raccoon, soda bottle, and a background asset to create my game. The rest I made using AESPRITE, a pixel art application.
